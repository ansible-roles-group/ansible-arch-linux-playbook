# Ansible _Arch Linux_ Playbook

An Ansible playbook to setup an Arch Linux desktop from scratch.

## Background

Since many years I always wanted to have a backup solution for my working desktop machine thats get me back on track after a hardware fail in no time with ease. After my first contact with Ansible I knew this is my way to go.

## What you get

This playbook is an example of my full setup. I keep sensitive data out of my public Ansible roles. But this playbook will be fully functional. If you setup the few config variables to your own needs it will setup a complete desktop system from an Arch Linux base installation for without interaction. You could grab yourself a cup of tea and come back later to see if your internet connection was strong enough and the setup finished in the meantime.

## Batteries included

The following will give you an overview of the Ansible roles included in this playbook and the config variable you can setup for your own needs.
